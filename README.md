# eshop-suggestions
Suggestions for game info pages I should show and read out on camera in the Wii U or 3DS eShops. Submissions close February 15, 2023. Please check the rules before submitting.

Rules:
1. No harassment or bigotry in the submissions (this should be a given; used to have this as rule 0, but markdown lists apparently can't start at 0 and it broke)
2. Nothing Rated M
3. Nothing that's already in the list below
4. Please submit suggestions via the Issues tab
5. Submissions close February 15, 2023, but if the Wii U and 3DS eShops are still open, I might be able to accept last-minute suggestions
6. I'm having a hard time coming up with other rules/remembering ones I thought of last night, so I'll moderate as I see fit

Current planned list:
(please note, I don't know what the for-sure list will be yet, so I can't put anything here for now)
