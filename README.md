# eshop-suggestions
Suggestions for game or DLC info pages (or other pages, if you want to see something specific that I might not cover) I should show and read out on camera in the Wii U or 3DS eShops when I do my video tour series for them. Submissions close February 15, 2023. Please check the rules before submitting.

Neither this repo nor I (Drew Naylor) are associated with Nintendo, and Nintendo does not endorse this repo. Wii U, 3DS, eShop (I'd assume, because it seems unique enough of a name), and any other similar words or phrases are property of Nintendo. Anything else (such as game names) belongs to its proper copyright holders.

Rules:
1. No harassment or bigotry in the submissions (this should be a given; used to have this as rule 0, but markdown lists apparently can't start at 0 and it broke)
2. Nothing Rated M
3. Nothing that's already in the list below
4. Please submit suggestions via the Issues tab, or by tagging me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/DrewTNaylor) or Mastodon (https://mastodon.online/@DrewNaylor)
5. Submissions close February 15, 2023, but if the Wii U and 3DS eShops are still open, I might be able to accept last-minute suggestions
6. I'm having a hard time coming up with other rules/remembering ones I thought of last night, so I'll moderate as I see fit
7. Don't waste my time
8. No spam
