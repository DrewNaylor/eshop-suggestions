Rules:
0. No harassment or bigotry in the submissions (this should be a given)
1. Nothing Rated M
2. Nothing that's already in the list below
3. Please submit suggestions via the Issues tab
4. Submissions close February 15, 2023, but if the Wii U and 3DS eShops are still open, I might be able to accept last-minute suggestions
5. I'm having a hard time coming up with other rules/remembering ones I thought of last night, so I'll moderate as I see fit

Current planned list:
(please note, I don't know what the for-sure list will be yet, so I can't put anything here for now)
