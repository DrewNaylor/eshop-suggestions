# eshop-suggestions
Suggestions for game or DLC info pages (or other pages, if you want to see something specific that I might not cover) I should show and read out on camera in the Wii U or 3DS eShops when I do my video tour series for them. Submissions close February 15, 2023. Please check the rules before submitting.

Neither this repo nor I (Drew Naylor) are associated with Nintendo, and Nintendo does not endorse this repo. Wii U, 3DS, eShop (I'd assume, because it seems unique enough of a name), and any other similar words or phrases are property of Nintendo. Anything else (such as game names) belongs to its proper copyright holders.

Rules:
1. No harassment or bigotry in the submissions (this should be a given; used to have this as rule 0, but markdown lists apparently can't start at 0 and it broke)
2. Nothing Rated M
3. Nothing that's already in the list below
4. Please submit suggestions via the Issues tab, or by tagging me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/DrewTNaylor) or Mastodon (https://mastodon.online/@DrewNaylor)
5. Submissions close February 15, 2023, but if the Wii U and 3DS eShops are still open, I might be able to accept last-minute suggestions
6. I'm having a hard time coming up with other rules/remembering ones I thought of last night, so I'll moderate as I see fit
7. Don't waste my time
8. No spam

Current planned list:
(please note, this is just games that have been suggested; I have other ideas written down separately)
Wii U:
- Affordable Space Adventures (thanks, Christaan Kras and scribe!; "best with 3 people" - scribe)
- Chew Man Fu ("hidden gem, with unique gameplay"; Turbografx 16/VC; thanks, Arindam!)
- Kirby and the Rainbow Paintbrush (thanks, Arindam!)
- Swords and Soldiers ("works very well with the stylus and gamepad"; thanks, Arindam!)
- Unepic (thanks, Arindam!)
- Ziggurat (thanks, Arindam!)
- Race the Sun (thanks, scribe!)
- NES Remix (thanks, scribe!)
- Tank! Tank! Tank! (may not be available anymore; thanks, scribe!)
- Mario Kart (assuming 8, because it's in a Wii U list; thanks, scribe!)
- Xenoblade X (on scribe's playlist, but was going to show it anyway; thanks, scribe!)
- "all the Zelda's" (on scribe's playlist, but may as well go through them; thanks, scribe!)

3DS:
- Nintendo Pocket Football Club (thanks, Christaan Kras!)
- River City Tokyo Rumble ("completely new River City game"; thanks, Humbird0 Fandom!)
- Dragon Quest 8 ("lets you save anywhere" like Dream Team; thanks, Humbird0 Fandom!)
- Silver Falls - Deathly Delusion Destroyers/Silver Falls - Ruby River (the final 3DS exclusives to be published on the eShop as Nintendo pulled a miracle and worked with Jerrel Dulay to allow them to be launched with an update planned for a few weeks later to fix a bug in the engine Nintendo previously rejected the games for; they're part of the same package and cost $16.99 US [only going to be available in the US because NoE couldn't help keep the door open long enough, and I don't know for sure about Japan]; check out this video for full details [note: has birds making noise in the background]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Wjvaar6hc ; I placed this here myself as it's very cool to look at the last eShop game)
